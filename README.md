# ESC-50
Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) is becoming more and more popular finding multiple applications in the fields of surveillance systems and noise cancelling. 
In this project, we propose a new preprocessing of the features as well as a new approach to the training of the Neural Networks in the sound classification framework. We then use different Convolutional Neural
Networks to analyse both the mel-spectograms (logmel CNN, AUG logmel CNN) and the raw data (RAW CNN). Finally, the results are combined using Dempster Shafer (DS) theory to reach similar results to those of humans in the ESC-50 dataset: a dataframe containing examples from 50 different categories of sounds. Overall, this paper is intended to serve as a valuable
resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of environmental sound classification: we believe that our approach to the feature extraction and training can be applied to any other architecture to improve the performance and generalise better.
